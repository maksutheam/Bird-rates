# OceanPeli
 
Bird-rates is a game in which you plan and execute heists on the seven seas!

It was originally made for Godot Wild Jam #41 with the theme being "Ocean". I watched a CGP Greys video(s) about pirates, and thought that it would make a great game.

It has bugs, but I'll fix those later (or if at all!)
